The findings suggest a clear demographic profile for the target audience. The high concentration of users in specific countries and with a particular education level indicates that marketing and content strategies are most effective within these segments.

## Conclusions

The dataset provided meaningful insights into technology trends, helping us understand shifts in programming languages and databases over time. It is clear that HTML/CSS is most used and desired programming language, Postgress is most used and desired database, AWS is most used platform. Job seekers must have minimum of Bachelors degree and have most of the top skills to get good compensation.
